**Go Test eXtended tool with coverage support**

GoTestX extends the standard [`go test`](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/go#hdr-Test_packages) command with a simpler, more versatile interface.  
It adds optional coverage reporting, quiet mode, and clean output filtering â€” while remaining fully compatible with `go test`.

---

## âœ¨ Features

- **Coverage mode** (`-c`): generates `coverage.out` with `-covermode=atomic`.
- **Open coverage** (`-o`): opens the HTML coverage report in a browser (macOS only).
- **Quiet mode** (`-q`): suppresses info logs, only shows test results and errors.
- **Clean mode** (`-C`): removes `? â€¦ [no test files]` lines for cleaner output.
- **Flag combinations**: short flags can be combined (e.g. `-cq`, `-coq`, `-cC`).
- **Smart package detection**:
  - Expands `./pkg` â†’ `./pkg/...` if root has no Go files but subpackages do.
  - Reports errors if a path doesnâ€™t exist or has no Go files.
