GoTestX extends the standard [`go test`](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/go#hdr-Test_packages) command with a simpler, more versatile interface.
It adds optional coverage reporting, quiet mode, and clean output filtering â€” while remaining fully compatible with `go test`.

## âœ¨ Features

* **Coverage mode** (`-c`): generates `coverage.out` with `-covermode=atomic`.
* **Open coverage** (`-o`): opens the HTML coverage report in a browser (macOS only).
* **Quiet mode** (`-q`): suppresses info logs, only shows test results and errors.
* **Clean mode** (`-C`): removes `? â€¦ [no test files]` lines for cleaner output.
* **Flag combinations**: short flags can be combined (e.g. `-cq`, `-coq`, `-cC`).
* **Smart package detection**:

    * Expands `./pkg` â†’ `./pkg/...` if root has no Go files but subpackages do.
    * Reports errors if a path doesnâ€™t exist or has no Go files.
