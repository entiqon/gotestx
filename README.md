GoTestX extends the standard [`go test`](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/go#hdr-Test_packages) command with a simpler, more versatile interface.  
It adds optional coverage reporting, quiet mode, and clean output filtering — while remaining fully compatible with `go test`.

## ✨ Features

* **Coverage mode** (`-c`): generates `coverage.out` with `-covermode=atomic`.
* **Open coverage** (`-o`): opens the HTML coverage report in a browser (macOS only).
* **Quiet mode** (`-q`): suppresses verbose chatter, but always reports:
  * ✅ success if all tests passed
  * coverage % if `-c` is enabled
  * ❌ failure (with hint to rerun without `-q`)
* **Clean view** (`-V`): removes `? … [no test files]` lines for cleaner output.
* **Flag combinations**: short flags can be combined (e.g. `-cq`, `-coq`, `-cVq`).
* **Smart package detection**:
  * Expands `./pkg` → `./pkg/...` if root has no Go files but subpackages do.
  * Reports errors if a path doesn’t exist or has no Go files.

## 🧪 Examples

Run tests for all packages:

```bash
gotestx
```

Run tests with coverage:

```bash
gotestx -c ./...
```

Run quietly with coverage (only one summary line):

```bash
gotestx -cq ./...
```

Run with coverage and open report in browser (macOS):

```bash
gotestx -o ./...
```

Run with clean output (no `[no test files]` lines):

```bash
gotestx -V ./...
```

Combine flags:

```bash
gotestx -cVq ./...
```

## 🖥 Sample Output

```
Running tests normally across: ./internal/...
ok  	github.com/entiqon/gotestx/internal	0.359s
```

Quiet run:

```
✅ Tests finished successfully
```

Quiet + coverage:

```
ok  	github.com/entiqon/gotestx/internal	0.359s	coverage: 100.0% of statements
```

Quiet with failure:

```
❌ Tests failed (use without -q to see details)
```

Clean view:

```
ok  	github.com/entiqon/gotestx/internal/join	0.01s
```

(no `[no test files]` lines)
